## Overview
ChurnMonitor is an AI-powered application that predicts whether bank customers are likely to leave based on their profile data. The model analyzes customer characteristics and behaviors to identify potential churn risk, enabling proactive customer retention strategies.

## Usage
1. Input customer details using the provided form controls
2. Click the "Predict" button to get the churn probability
3. View the prediction result with visual indicators

##  Live Demo
Experience the prediction model in action: [ChurnMonitor App](https://churnmonitoring.streamlit.app/)
